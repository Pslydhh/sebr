# Scalable Epoch-Based Reclamation
SEBR as a general scheme based on C++17 to reclaim memory safely in Multithreading scenario.
- It's also could called "**Small Epoch-Based Reclaimation**", as It work on the basis of such a fact: Reclaim all memorys below smallest epoch.
- Or It's means "**Self-Management Epoch-Based Reclaimation**", because it handle the cooperation and race between many threads and many concurrent data structures perfectly.

SEBR's design target consists of 3 parts:
- **Usability**: //TODO
- **Reusability**: //TODO
- **Scalability**:  //TODO
